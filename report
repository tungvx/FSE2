1. calculate lev, val for lDV
2. cgen for 1-dim array: both left and right hand side
3. Support if else stmt
4. Extend the interpretor so that when bexpr is: + - * / % cc content is changed
5. Modify parser2.c so that after inserting function name into sym table, we store the idx of the inserted symbol into the ival field of AST name of function.
6. When generate begin_label for function decl, we insert that label to val field in the sym table.
7. Support function call
8. Support args for function call.
9. When condition expression of if stmt is not a logical expression (just is some arithmatic expression) we will decrease the TOS by 1 after calculation.
10. support multi-dimenstional array
11. support datatypes: int (lev = 1), char (lev = 2), float (lev = 3), string (lev = 4)
12. support while stmt, change parser1.c, ast.c in order to parse while stmt.
13. support break stmt, need to change parser1.c, ast.c.
14. support continue stmt, changed parser1.c, ast.c
